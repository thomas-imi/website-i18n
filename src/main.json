  "423222878": "Some of the hardest cyberattacks to detect, prevent and stop are ones where a malicious actor is able to use legitimate user credentials to log into an active user account. Without a lot of sophisticated detection capabilities in place, the company hosting the account has no reason to suspect that anything is wrong. A customer simply appears to have logged into his or her account. The attacker achieved this successful ruse using stolen credentials—usually the result of a cyberattack technique known as “credential stuffing.” It’s a serious problem today, but one that can be mitigated with the right countermeasures.",

  "1258965840": "Thus, if the attacker can get into one site, he can probably get into multiple sites using the spilled credentials. For instance, they might get a username/password pair like JohnDoe/525momma, but they have no idea what that pair will do for them. So, they try the pair on Amazon.com, Ebay, Citibank, Walgreens and on and on. They might try that pair on a thousand different sites.",
  "1271831121": "It’s not as if the hacker (clad in a hoodie, of course!) is sitting there, typing in credential after credential. The automated login bot could be made from an off-the-shelf tool like Selenium or a custom-developed hacker tool.",
  "1559150837": "Targets aren't defenseless though. Most websites have controls that block a suspicious user who is trying to log into thousands of different accounts from the same IP address in a short space of time. What credential stuffing attackers do to get around these protection techniques is this is to simulate geographic and IP diversity. Using powerful, often AI-driven tools, they can make it appear that thousands of users are randomly trying to log in at different times of day from all over the country. This is a lot harder to detect and stop.",

  "2597149484": "The reason the hacker has to “stuff” so many credentials has to do with where they get their stolen credentials.",
  "2602763587": "Credential stuffing is a form of cyberattack wherein the attacker tries to log into a website multiple times using pairs of stolen usernames and passwords. The “stuffing” refers to the repetitive login attempts, which are almost always performed by automated bot software.",
  "3030395800": "These credentials usually come from data breaches. Also known as “credential spills,” these attacks can result in millions of credentials getting dumped onto the dark web. If the spill came from a  bank, the hacker will try to use those credentials to get onto other sites. This approach works because so many people use the same username and password combination for multiple sites. (This practice is discouraged, but reality is what it is. People tend to repeat the same login credentials.)",

The scraping software acts like a human user, clicking on buttons and reading the resulting output. There are many legitimate uses for scraping. Web crawlers that power search engines are one example. So are tools like Skyscanner that look for travel deals by combing through thousands of travel websites. Fintech firms use it, too, scraping user’s financial data from bank sites if there are no Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) available to make the data connection. The things to keep in mind about screen scraping are its speed and scalability. The process can harvest immense amounts of data from websites, assuming the sites are not configured to stop it from happening. At the speed of compute, a scraper can amass large datasets by interacting with websites and the underlying software and databases that power them.",
  "4087694419": "A scraping hacker could also gather data from sites like Amazon and eBay to create fake or deceptive product listings. He or she could then offer them for sale on peer-to-peer services like OfferUp and conduct phishing attacks on the buyers. Or, the fraudster could sell products that don’t exist.A further screen scraping fraud involves faking out ad publishers. By scraping the content from publisher sites, the fraudster can create fake ad publisher pages on different services. They can then sell ads on those pages to authorized resellers, whose contacts they harvested from the publisher’s ads.txt file. The ad slots appear real to the advertiser, but they are not.",

Even then, business owners were concerned that not everyone they were dealing with was on the up and up. A lot has changed in 10,000 years, but the need to be innovative in preventing fraud remains with us. Today, the issue of online payment fraud is of paramount importance.

These are APIs built using open standards like Representational State Transfer (REST) and open standard file formats like JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). Such “RESTful APIs,” as they are known, can be created without the need for proprietary software. The resulting APIs are able to send and receive data and procedure calls between software applications. For example, a mobile banking app uses an API to access the bank’s systems.",

After all, if it stealing data simply requires a basic GET call on an API, written using REST and JSON, then it’s easy to quickly strip a database clean. In fact, when people talk about “screen scraping” attacks, what they really mean, mostly, are rapid-fire API calls that pull data out of databases.
